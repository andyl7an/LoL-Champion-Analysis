    "   Since Riot Games launched \"League of Legends\" in 2009, it has grown to become the most popular game in the world, boasting an average of over 27 million players online per day. The game revolves around a total of ten players per match, pit against one another in two teams of five. Each of these players are given a choice of 129 unique champions to play as. \n",
    "   Due to the competitive nature of the game, each player is given a rank ranging from bronze to challenger, determined by their ratio of wins to losses. The goal of this report is to analyze trends in how a champion specialization affects player ranking and to determine if there is any correlation between the different champions played."
